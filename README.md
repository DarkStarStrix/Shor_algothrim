Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer. 
It was developed in 1994 by the American mathematician Peter Shor. It is one of the few known quantum algorithms with compelling potential applications and strong evidence of super polynomial speedup compared to best known classical (that is, non-quantum) algorithms. 
On the other hand, factoring numbers of practical significance requires far more qubits than available in the near future. 
Another concern is that noise in quantum circuits may undermine results, requiring additional qubits for quantum error correction.
